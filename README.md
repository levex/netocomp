Netocomp
========

This is an online computer simulator. Allows you to move data to and
from registers. This is a very basic project made to try out OpenShift.

Sometimes it might not even work, so don't take it too seriously
and try to port Linux to it. It only support 'mov $src $dest'
instruction yet. Also, no RAM. Only registers.

OpenShift is cool
